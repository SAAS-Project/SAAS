## Our Motivations
Developers usually have to download a number of tools to set up a dev environment. For a simple web server, this means downloading and installing the language library, a database client, external CLI tools to perform database migrations, a GUI code editor, a GUI database client. To further complicate things, developers may also be using different machines with different OSes. This has a high chance of causing cross-platform compatibility issues that may arise during initial setup or daily workflow
